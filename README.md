## What is Peer Coder? ü§î

#### Remote pair programming is something developers have grappled with since well before the pandemic began. 
#### Peercoder is basically a platform where two peers can do their interview preparation by practicing DSA problems and improve their problem solving skills.
#### Peer Coder is ideal for Online Interviewing of Developers as well as Learning to code from Friends.


## How it works? ü§î
- **Open the website [https://peercoder.adaptable.app/](https://peercoder.adaptable.app/)**
- **Peer just needs to send same Room Name/id to another peer in order to join a room where apart from practicing problems they can share location, also they can communicate by doing normal chat as well as video chat with each other.**
- **For Video Chat, peer just need to copy a unique id and send it to peer with whom he/she want to chat.**
- **For group video chat part, user may join meeting as host or as an attendee. Also in it audio and video controls can be easily controlled by the user.**
- **Screen sharing feature is also available for every user in case of group video chat.**
